	<p>I'm a lover of all things creative. My creative career was triggered in middle school, when I was obsessed with Japanese manga and anime. I taught myself to create stylized digital illustrations with Photoshop, and becoming familiar with that program opened my world to endless possibilities. I'm currently interested in mobile applications, and would love to work as an UIUX designer.</p>
	<h2>My hobbies include:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Casual gaming: My favorite titles are Animal Crossing, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Ace Attorney, Zero Escape, and Mario Cart. </li>
			<li> Drawing: I like digital illustrations the best, but I also enjoy paints, watercolors, and the good 'ol pencil and paper. </li>
			<li> Learning the guitar: I want to be a rockstar one day.</li>
		</ul>
