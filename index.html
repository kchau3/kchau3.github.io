	<p>I'm a lover of all things creative, especially art, design, and advertising. I studied psychology at Boston University, but decided to pursue my passion in the creative field instead. I've been working as a graphic designer, and would like to transition into an UIUX role.</p>
	<h2>My hobbies include:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Casual gaming: My favorite titles are Animal Crossing, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Ace Attorney, Zero Escape, and Mario Cart. </li>
			<li> Drawing: I like digital illustrations the best, but I also enjoy paints, watercolors, and the good 'ol pencil. </li>
			<li> Learning the guitar: I want to be a rockstar one day.</li>
		</ul>
